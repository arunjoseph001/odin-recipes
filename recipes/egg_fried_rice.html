    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 1 cup of washed and drained, Basmati rice and soak it in 2 cups of water. Let it soak for 30 minutes. After soaking, add it to 4 cups (1 litre) of boiling water and let it cook till 90% done. The flame should be kept high till rolling boil. When it starts to rolling boil, set the flame on medium. Add 1½ teaspoon of Salt and 1 tablespoon of Refined Oil into the water. Since it is soaked for 30 minutes, the cooking will be done as soon as it starts to rolling boil. Drain the water completely using a strainer. After 2 minutes, spread the rice on two plates to cool down and keep it in the refrigerator for minimum 2 hours. The rice prepared in the said way will be separate and won't clump at all.</li>
        <li>To prepare eggs, heat 1 tablespoon Refined Oil in a kadai and add 3 eggs to it. Into that, add a pinch of salt, ¼ teaspoon of pepper and scramble them and move it into another pan.</li>
        <li>Into the same kadai, add 3 tablespoon of Refined Oil and heat it. Add 2 teaspoon of finely chopped Garlic and sauté it slightly. Add ¼ cup of the bulb of Spring Onion (white portion), ¼ cup of chopped Carrots, ¼ cup of chopped Beans, 2 tablespoon of chopped Capsicum (Optional), ¼ cup of chopped Cabbage and sauté it for 1 minute. Unlike traditional cooking, you don't have to cook it for too long. A light stir fry is enough on high flame.</li>
        <li>After sautéing for 1 minute, add the scrambled eggs and mix them together. If you want Chicken Fried Rice, use cooked chicken using salt and pepper, and add it along with scrambled eggs. If you need Mixed Fried Rice, you may use cooked Beef or Prawns along with this.</li>
        <li>There are mainly 2 ways to avoid breaking of rice. One, is to toss the rice as they do in restaurants. Other, by mixing and folding using a wooden spatula.</li>
